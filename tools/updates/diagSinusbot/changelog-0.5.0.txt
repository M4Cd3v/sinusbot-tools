Added check mechanism if using TS3 client 3.1 and later with Sinusbot 0.9.18 and older, which is not working due to TS3 client API changes.
Added outgoing HTTPS access checks, IPv4- and IPv6-only modes.
Additionally searching for initd-script at /etc/init.d/ts3bot.
Now checking DNS resolution of sinusbot.com instead of Google.com.
Improved version compare handling.
Fixed some typos.
General improvements.
